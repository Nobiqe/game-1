# 🎮🚀 Game Project

This 📂 contains two 🐍 implementations of a 🖥️-based 🎮 using the `curses` 📚. The 🎮 involves a 👨‍🚀-controlled 🚀 navigating a 📦, collecting 🍕, avoiding 👾, and interacting with 🌀.

## 📄 Files

### 1. `main.py`
A ⚙️ implementation of the 🎮 with 🌎 variables and functions.
- Uses a 🖥️-based UI.
- 🔥 Features:
  - 🎲 world generation.
  - 🏃‍♂️ of 👨‍🚀 and 👾.
  - 🍕 collection and 🏆 tracking.
  - 🕳️ as special elements.
  - ☠️ conditions.
- 🎮 Controls:
  - `WASD` for 🏃‍♂️
  - `R` to 🔄
  - `Q` to ❌

### 2. `oop_1.py`
An 🏗️ implementation using a `Game` 🎭.
- Encapsulates 🧠 within the `Game` 🎭.
- Improves 🔲 and 🔄.
- The 🏗️ remains similar to `main.py`, but with better 📏 and 🛠️.

## 📌 Requirements
- 🐍 3
- `curses` (available in 🔧 for 🐧/🍎, `windows-curses` needed for 🖥️🪟)

## ▶️ How to Run
Run either 📄 in a 🖥️:
```sh
python main.py
```
or
```sh
python oop_1.py
```

For 🖥️🪟, install `curses` before 🔄:
```sh
pip install windows-curses
```

🎉 Enjoy the 🎮!
